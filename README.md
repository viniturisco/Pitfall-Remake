# Pitfall! Remake (Version 1.0)

Welcome to the first official release of our remake of the classic **Pitfall!**.

This project was developed by students of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the Instituto Federal de São Paulo (IFSP), Salto Campus, for the Digital Entertainment course.

## 🌴 About the Game

**Pitfall!** follows the adventures of **Harry Pitfall**, a fearless explorer seeking long-forgotten treasures in a treacherous tropical jungle.

The game's setting is a retro forest with independent 2D screens, featuring simple visuals and flat colors in the **Atari 2600 style**.

## 🏃 Gameplay Mechanics

The gameplay mechanics are relatively simple: the player can walk, jump, climb and descend ladders, and swing on vines.

*   **Objective:** The goal is to progress through the screens, collecting coins and chests, to achieve the maximum score of **9900 points**.
*   **Challenges:** The jungle is filled with traps, such as holes and rolling logs, and enemies, including alligators (*jacarés*), scorpions, and snakes. Players must dodge enemies and their attacks, as they cannot be defeated.
*   **Survival:** Losing all **3 lives** or running out of the **3-minute time limit** results in a game over.
*   **Environments:** Stages are connected horizontally and include the surface, lakes with crocodiles, underground tunnels (which function as alternate, faster routes), and treasure rooms.
